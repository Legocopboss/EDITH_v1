You can use it to retrieve current weather conditions, forecasts, and other weather-related information from AccuWeather. Let me know if you need any further assistance!"

    "content": "Certainly! Here's the equivalent Python script for the function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\ndef accuweather_api_request(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    # You can use the 'requests' library to make HTTP requests\n    import requests\n    \n    # Extract the necessary parameters from the config\n    endpoint = config.get('endpoint')\n    method = config.get('method')\n    queryParams = config.get('queryParams')\n    body = config.get('body')\n    \n    # Make the API request\n    url = f\"https://api.accuweather.com/{endpoint}\"\n    headers = {\n        # Add any necessary headers here\n    }\n    params = queryParams if queryParams else {}\n    data = body if body else {}\n    \n    if method == 'GET':\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)\n    elif method == 'POST':\n        response = requests.post(url, params=params, headers=headers, json=data)\n    elif method == 'PUT':\n        response = requests.put(url, params=params, headers=headers, json=data)\n    elif method == 'DELETE':\n        response = requests.delete(url, params=params, headers=headers, json=data)\n    else:\n        return {'error': 'Invalid method'}\n    \n    # Extract and return the response JSON\n    return response.json()\n```\n\nYou can use this Python script to make requests to the AccuWeather API by passing in the necessary configuration parameters (endpoint, method, queryParams, body) as a dictionary to the `accuweather_api_request` function. The function will return the JSON response from the API. Remember to install the `requests` library if you haven't already, as it's required for making HTTP requests. Let me know if you have any further questions!"
