You can fill in the code to fetch news from a news API or another relevant source.\n\n2. `getWeather`: This function is designed to obtain weather information. Again, you'll need to write the necessary code to fetch weather data from a weather API or any suitable resource.\n\n3. `getCurrentEvents`: This function is for accessing other current events beyond news and weather. You can customize it to collect data based on your requirements.\n\nFeel free to modify these functions and add your own implementation. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
