    "content": "The formula for the future value of an annuity with interest compounded yearly is:\n\nFV = P * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r\n\nWhere:\n- FV is the future value of the annuity\n- P is the periodic payment (amount deposited or withdrawn each period)\n- r is the interest rate per period\n- n is the total number of periods\n- The annuity is compounded yearly\n\nThis formula calculates the total amount (FV) that will accumulate in the annuity after n periods, given the periodic payment (P) and the interest rate per period (r)."

    "content": "If you're asking about the payment amount (P) in the annuity formula, it refers to the periodic payment made towards the annuity. In other words, it represents the amount of money deposited or withdrawn each period. The payment amount (P) is a fixed value throughout the entire annuity period."

    "content": "To solve the equation A = (P ((1 + (r/n))^n*t - 1)) / (r/n) for P, we can manipulate the equation algebraically. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Multiply both sides of the equation by (r/n):\n   A * (r/n) = P * ((1 + (r/n))^n*t - 1)\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by ((1 + (r/n))^n*t - 1):\n   A * (r/n) / ((1 + (r/n))^n*t - 1) = P\n\nSo, the value of P in terms of the other variables (A, r, n, and t) is:\n\nP = A * (r/n) / ((1 + (r/n))^n*t - 1)\n\nThis equation allows you to calculate the periodic payment needed to achieve a desired future value (A) over a certain number of periods (t), with an interest rate (r) compounded annually (n times per year)."
